## Algorithims

A step of steps or instruction a program takes to complete a task. An algorithm needs a clearly defined problem, input and output. Its steps must have a specific order; these steps must be distinct (i.e they cannot be broken down even further); these steps must produce a result and must end in finite time. An algorithm is judged in terms of its correctness and efficiency (time and space complexity).
